ðŸŒ¿ NatureCommerce
NatureCommerce is a project inspired by the layout and functionality of Amazon.com, but with a twistâ€”our focus is on promoting the use of plants and trees in everyday life. Instead of materialistic items, this website emphasizes the importance of nature, aiming to bring users closer to the environment and reduce the focus on materialism.
ðŸŒ³ As developers- we spend most of our time indoors- let's give a positive touch to our lives by adding these greens , as i have done by adding them as my first project in Git, 
Fostering a sense of peace and well-being that combats the negative effects of materialistic culture. 



ðŸ›  Technologies Used
HTML5: The backbone of the website, providing structure to the content.
CSS3: Styling the project with a nature-themed aesthetic.
